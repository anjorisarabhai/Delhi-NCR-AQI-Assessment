# Delhi NCR Air Quality Assessment (2020-Present)

## Project Description

This project aims to assess air quality trends and patterns in the Delhi National Capital Region (NCR), India, from 2020 to the present. It utilizes satellite data from **Sentinel-5P** (via Google Earth Engine) and ground-level monitoring data from the **Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)**.

A key objective is to model and understand the discrepancy between satellite column measurements and ground-level concentrations, investigating the influence of hyperlocal factors like **traffic density**, **land use/land cover**, and **urban morphology**.
